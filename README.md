# ColorOff
A swift take on swift

## Goal
* Match the right box color to the left using the 3 RGB Sliders. Simple! (or so it seems)

## Mechanics
* Start up app
* 2 colored boxes will be generated
* Adjust color sliders and match boxes as precisely as you can
* Hit "Am I a designer?" to check your score!
  * Score is computed based on the difference of each color range 0-255
* A score of `100` means a perfect match, and you win!

> I have never personally reached 100!!! Embarassing~
